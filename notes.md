- people in the same geographic region may look at the same documents (e.g. for class, cultural, etc)
- eliminate cost of ownership to wikimedia (i.e. their fundrasiers are mostly to host servers)

## Challenges:
- document discovery (esp. newly created documents)
- propogating updates
- availablility (never want a document availabl)
